First, load the package we need for this assignment.

```{r load_package, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

First, we load the `penguins` dataset:

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Next, we describe the characteristics of the `penguins` dataset

* This dataset includes the `r ncol(penguins)` variables for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins

* This dataset consists of descriptive data for `r n_distinct(penguins$species)` different species of penguins, including which island they reside on, year, sex, and information on their size such as body mass, bill length and depth, and flipper length.

* The mean flipper length for the penguins is `r round(mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), 2)` mm
