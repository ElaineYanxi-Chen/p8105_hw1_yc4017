First, we load the package needed for this assignment.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

First, we load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Next, we describe the characteristics of the `penguins` dataset:

-   This dataset includes the 8 variables for 344 penguins

-   This dataset consists of descriptive data for 3 different species of
    penguins, including which island they reside on, year, sex, and
    information on their size such as body mass, bill length and depth,
    and flipper length.

-   The mean flipper length for the penguins is 200.92 mm

Now, we make a scatterplot and save it as a pdf:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point()
```
