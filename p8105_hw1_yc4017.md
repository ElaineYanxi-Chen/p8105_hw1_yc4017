First, we load the package needed for this assignment.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

First, we load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Next, we describe the characteristics of the `penguins` dataset:

-   This dataset includes the 8 variables for 344 penguins

-   This dataset consists of descriptive data for 3 different species of
    penguins, including which island they reside on, year, sex, and
    information on their size such as body mass, bill length and depth,
    and flipper length.

-   The mean flipper length for the penguins is 200.92 mm

Now, we make a scatterplot and save it as a pdf:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("penguins_scatterplot.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

First, we create a data frame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0

-   a character vector of length 10

-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
hw_df =
  tibble(
    var_numeric = rnorm(n = 10),
    var_logic = var_numeric > 0,
    var_char = c("Data", "science", "is", "a", "struggle", "but", "I", "really", "enjoy", "it"),
    var_factor = factor(c("easy", "medium", "hard", "medium", "medium", "easy", "hard", "easy", "hard", "hard"))
  )
```
